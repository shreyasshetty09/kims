                                <p class="mb-2 para_text1">Blessing of Love, Joy and Peace to all who access this website of St. Agnes’ Higher Primary School.<br>
                                Thanks to the Almighty! for his immeasurable graces and infinite love that has always led this Institution from the  time of its inception since 1854. With “Do Well all that You do” as our motto, we have been scaling great heights in shaping the total development of each person in her uniqueness, so that she becomes intellectually alert, spiritually oriented, emotionally balanced, morally sound, socially committed, physically healthy and culturally enriched. </p>
                                <p class="mb-2 para_text1"><b>Our Mission Statement</b> says that our mission as<b> Good Shepherd Sisters</b> in India is by prayer and sacrifice and by means of qualitative educational, health abs social Ministries to bring Reconciliation through our own experience of the merciful love of Jesus, the Good Shepherd to all, especially girls  and women who are poor and exploited . </p>
                                <p class="mb-2 para_text1">The Bible speaks of not only the physically poor but also the spiritually poor or the poor in spirit. Jesus chose to be born poor and lived among the poor, He identified himself as a friend of the poor and the marginalized, “whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers and sisters, you did it to me”(Mathew 25:40). Through many of us would not prefer to be poor by choice, it is strange that poverty has its own merits. Or else Jesus would not have included Poverty as one of the beatitudes. “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven (Mathew 5:3). Saints and sages over the years have proved that the poor share the biggest wealth they have, and that is, happiness! </p>
                                <p class="mb-2 para_text1">The world is divided into haves and have-nots! In a country like India, it is said that 80% of the wealth of the country is concentrated in the hands of 10% of the population. While the rich have access to everything because of their means and resources, the poor are to be satisfied with what is available or affordable to them. </p>
                                <p class="mb-2 para_text1">Its horizon is already dotted with skyscrapers and concrete jungle. Business, commerce and the rat race of competition for survival have reduced life of the commoners to one of tension and disillusionment. Unemployment, underemployment and the burden of  the family with their varied problems have dehumanized life. Are we poor-friendly? </p>
                                <p class="mb-2 para_text1">This year 2020 is dedicated as the <b>Year of the Poor</b>. This theme would help us to keep focused on the basic needs of the poor around us. I do not wish to live under the  false illusion that all the problems of the poor will be eradicated in one year. Of course, it is impossible! But this attempt will surely enable us to be aware of the poor and the marginalized around us, and help us to come closer to them and plan out short term and long term solutions. </p>
                                <p class="mb-2 para_text1">I conclude with   the quote of Pope Francis, “This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, to understand who are really poor, on whom we are called to look upon in order to hear their cry and recognize their needs. The condition of poverty cannot be expressed in a word, but becomes a cry which crosses the heavens and reaches God”. </p>
